###Crime Mapper


[Crime Mapper](http://crimemapper310.appspot.com/) is a web application that users can access to find out information about various types of criminal activity in the City of Vancouver. This application is ideal for law enforcement agencies to see trends about various criminal activities and to have a geographical representation of where most criminal activities are taking place. 

Crime Mapper uses the [Open Layers Library](http://demo.gwt-openlayers.org/gwt_ol_showcase/GwtOpenLayersShowcase.html) for visual mapping of the Vancouver area and [HERE's API](https://developer.here.com/) for geocoding the criminal data.  Crime Mapper also uses the [Highcharts Library](http://www.moxiegroup.com/moxieapps/gwt-highcharts/) for charting purposes. This application was developed using Java with [GWT Framework] (http://www.gwtproject.org/), deployed with [Google App Engine] (https://appengine.google.com/) and data was sourced from [Vancouver Open Data Catalogue] (http://vancouver.ca/your-government/open-data-catalogue.aspx).
